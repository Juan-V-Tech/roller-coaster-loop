Rollercoaster Loop Simulation
This project simulates a rollercoaster loop and graphs the normal force and energies experienced by a cart as it moves along the track.

Requirements
- Anaconda Python (optional but recommended for easy environment setup) Available: https://www.anaconda.com/download
- NumPy
- VPython

You can install the necessary Python packages with:
pip install numpy vpython

Usage:
Simply run the provided Python script in an environment where both NumPy and VPython are installed.

Note:
Depending on your device or Python environment, you might need to make minor edits to the code for full compatibility (such as adjusting the main loop, handling imports, or changing display settings).

Features
- Real-time 3D visualization of the rollercoaster cart and track
- Energy and normal force graphs updating as the simulation runs
- Adjustable track and loop parameters via sliders
