Roller Coaster Loop Simulation with Real-Time Graphs

About:
This VPython project simulates a roller coaster loop and graphs the normal force and energies experienced by a cart as it moves along the track. Created with the intention of presentation to an undergraduate mechanics physics class, it provides a clear, visual demonstration of energy conservation and force dynamics. The real-time graphs offer insight into how energy and normal force vary throughout the loop.
This simulation is ideal for instructors to incorporate into lectures for academic enrichment. Maintenance of the simulation is important, so if any issues arise, please report an issue or contact me via one of my GitHub-connected social channels. While not guaranteed, I periodically provide feature updates. If youâ€™re interested in contributing or developing new features, feel free to reach out!

Local Requirements
- NumPy
- VPython
- Anaconda Python (optional but recommended for easy environment setup) Available: https://www.anaconda.com/download

You can install the necessary Python packages with:
pip install numpy vpython

Usage:
Run the provided Python script in an environment where both NumPy and VPython are installed.
Once running, use the on-screen sliders to adjust the drop height and loop radius, then click Reset to launch the cart using your edited parameters.

Note:
Depending on your device or Python environment, you may need to make minor edits to the code for full compatibility (such as adjusting the main loop, handling imports, or changing display settings).

Features
- Real-time 3D visualization of the rollercoaster cart and track
- Energy and normal force graphs are updating as the simulation runs
- Adjustable track and loop parameters via sliders
- Path Trail
